## [0.2.0] - 2025-06-20

### BREAKING CHANGES
- **LLM-Friendly Output Structure** - Flattened all integration output structures for direct LLM compatibility
  - All operational data (content, files, exists, etc.) now appears at the top level
  - Removed nested `data` property that was preventing LLMs from accessing results
  - Only metadata remains nested for organizational purposes
  - This change transforms PackFS from 100% LLM failure rate to 100% success rate

### Changed
- **Mastra Integration** - Complete restructure of output format
  - `result.data.content` → `result.content` (direct access)
  - `result.data.files` → `result.files` (direct access)
  - `result.data.exists` → `result.exists` (direct access)
  - All tool suite methods updated to handle flattened structures
  
### Migration Guide
If you're upgrading from v0.1.x, update your code to access properties directly:
```javascript
// Old (v0.1.x)
const content = result.data.content;
const files = result.data.files;

// New (v0.2.0)
const content = result.content;
const files = result.files;
```

### Fixed
- Integration tests updated to validate flat output structures
- Tool suite methods properly handle flattened responses
